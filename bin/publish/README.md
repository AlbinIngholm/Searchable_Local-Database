# Searchable Database programmed in WinForms.
This installer contains everything you need to run the program, but first place the DB_Server.mdf file in C:\Users\YourUser\Documents. This makes sure that the program finds the SQL Database.

This program was developed as a school project, and is available on github. If you decide to use it, please credit me (github.com/AlbinIngholm)

TODO:
The code that was commented out was an attempt at fetching driver pictures from an F1 Api. I did not have time to complete it, but feel free to contribute to the project by using a "fork and pull request". https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project
